        <h1>How Are Buildings Heated in New York City?</h1>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Harseerat Khaira, <strong>Published:</strong> 29-Nov-2019</p>
        <p>As winter approaches NYC, the city prepares for an influx of tourists looking to witness the lighting of the Rockefeller Center christmas tree, or perhaps catch a showing of 'A Christmas Carrol' on Broadway. There is also a huge infrastructural shift in the city that might go unnoticed by a lot of people. You've probably seen the signs of this shift and became curious (like me) about what's happening in the background. Perhaps you start noticing steam coming out of manhole covers in the street, and see the orange pylons acting like makeshift chimneys.</p>
        <p>You might also notice the background hiss of steam radiators firing up in your office, or hear water flowing through baseboard heaters in your aparment. Maybe your landlord neglected to turn on the heat in your building until you filed a complaint with the city, or until the pipes in the building were in danger of bursting? Or maybe your building is so overheated that you have to keep your windows open in the winter to stabalize the temperature?</p>
        <p>Complaining about heating troubles is a classic conversation peace in my experience, but it also helps if you have some context and understanding of how the system works. So, I will attempt to make your conversations more interesting by showing you how the heating system in NYC works.</p>
