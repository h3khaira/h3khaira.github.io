                    STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill
                    Development board over USB</h1>
                <p>
                    The STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill development board is a powerful alternative to a standard Arduino board
                    such
                    as
                    the Arduino Uno. It is equipped with a powerful 32-bit Arm processesor that is leagues ahead of the
                    ATmega
                    8-bit processors in an Arduino Uno. This is one of the main reasons I decided to use a Blue Pill
                    board
                    for
                    my drone flight controller project. However, I quickly realized the relative difficulty of setting
                    up a
                    development environment for this board to
                    allow for easy upload of code and debugging.
                </p>
                <p>So I have written this article to summarize what I've learned and help anyone else going through the
                    same
                    process. In this article I will go through how to set up a development environment for the Blue Pill
                    in
                    platform.io. Here's what we will need:</p>
                <ul class="list-group" style="padding-bottom: 1rem;">
                    <li class="list-group-item">An STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill development board</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">A mini USB cable</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">An ST-LINK/V2 debugger and programmer</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">4 x jumper cables</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Firstly, we need to flash the HID bootloader on the board to enable us to upload code through USB as
                    well as debugging through the serial monitor. For this, we will need the STM32 Cube Programmer,
                    which can be downloaded from
                    <a href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html">here.</a> In addition, we also
                    need
                    the bootloader binaries, which can be downloaded from the github repository found <a
                        href="https://github.com/Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader/releases">here.</a> Download the folder
                    labeled as "stm32_binaries.zip" and unzip this folder.
                </p>
                <p>Once the STM32 cube programmer is installed, connect the Blue Pill to your computer via the
                    ST-LINK/V2. Use jumper cables to connect the SWDIO, SWDCK, 3v and ground pins on the ST-LINK/V2 to
                    the Blue Pill. Within the cube programmer, navigate to the HID bootloader binary that applies to
                    your specific board. For my board the binary file was located in
                    <a style="font-style: italic;">/stm32_binaries/F103/low_and_medium_density/hid_generic_pc13.bin.</a>
                    Before flashing the bootloader, ensure that the BOOT0 jumper on the board is set to "1" as shown in
                    the image below. Once this
                    is done, flash this binary on the Blue Pill and move the BOOT0 jumper back to the "0" position, then
                    press the reset button. The built in LED on the board (marked below) should start rapidly
                    blinking if this is successfull. You can now unplug the ST-LINK/V2 from the board.
                </p>

                    style="width:40rem; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <p>This bootloader enables you to upload code and debug through the serial monitor on the Blue Pill,
                    eliminating the need to use an ST-LINK/V2. However, there are some special settings in Platform.io
                    we need to use for this to work. Below is what my platform.ini configuration file looks like using
                    the arduino framework on the Blue Pill. Ensure that you use the same build flags in your
                    configuration, otherwise the bootloader will be wiped after uploading code and you will have to
                    re-flash it on the board. Additionally, you might need to change the <a style="font-style: italic;">
                        upload_port</a> option depending on your setup.</p>

                <p>If you get the following error: "hid-flash not found" while trying to upload the program to the
                    board,
                    you can easily solve this by getting the appropriate hid-flash binary from the bootloader<a
                        href="https://github.com/Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader/releases"> here.</a> and placing it in
                    the <code>~/.platformio/packages/tool-stm32duino directory.</code>
                </p>
                <p>You might also face issues with uploading the program to the /dev/ttyACM0 port due to permissions
                    issues. In this case, simply add your user to the "dialout" group by running the command
                    <code>sudo adduser $USER dialout</code> and rebooting.</p>
