        <p>As winter approaches NYC, the city prepares for an influx of tourists looking to witness the lighting of the Rockefeller Center christmas tree, or perhaps catch a showing of 'A Christmas Carrol' on Broadway. There is also a huge infrastructural shift in the city that might go unnoticed by many people. You've probably seen the signs of this shift in the background of your everyday life. Perhaps you start noticing steam coming out of manhole covers in the street, and see the orange pylons that look like crude, plastic chimneys, venting steam from the ground like your breath on a cold day.</p>
        <p><img src="../static/images/pylon.jpg" alt="A steam chimney in NYC" width= "50%" style="float: left; margin-right: 1.5rem">You might also hear the quiet yet persistent hiss of steam radiators firing up in your office, or hear water flowing through baseboard heaters in your aparment. Maybe your landlord neglected to turn on the heat in your building until you filed a complaint with the city, or until the pipes in the building were in danger of bursting? Or maybe your building is so overheated that you have to keep your windows open in the winter to stabalize the temperature?</p>
		<p>This is a rather universal experience for someone who goes through a winter (or two) in the city, and complaining about heating troubles makes for good conversation. But it also helps if you have some context and understanding of how the system works. So, I will attempt to make your conversations more interesting by showing you how the heating system in NYC works.</p>
		<h2 class="subtitle">A Brief History of Heating</h2>
    <p>The human core temperature is approximately 95°F, and we need an environmental temperature of <a href="https://www.summitpost.org/the-science-of-warmth/359562"> approximtely 65°F and 130°F </a> to maintain a survivable core temperature. Therefore, survival during the winter has always been a challenge for humans. There is constant transfer of heat occuring between your body and its environemtn through conduction, convection, and radiation. Heat is lost from your body to the environemnt and also flows the other way from the environment to your body. If the heat leaving your body is more than what enters your body, your core temperature drops; and if the heat leaving your body is less than the heat entering it, your core temperature rises.</p>
    <p>Therefore, in order to survive in the winter, the goal is to minimize the amount of heat loss and maximize the heat gain to your body. Reducing the amount of heat leaving your body can be done by adding insulation around your body in the form of clothing. Clothing shields your body from outside air, reducing convective heat transfer, while also providing a buffer that acts as a shield against radiation.</p>
    <p>On the other side of the equation, you also need to increase the addition of heat to your body. Humans generate internal heat constantly at a rate known as the metabolic heat generation rate, which is approximately 100 Watts for the average human. This rate can increase or decrease based on the activity level of the person. If you are sufficienctly insulated, this heat generation alone might be enough to maintain or increase your body temperature. However, external sources have been utilized throughout history to aid with comfort.</p>
    <p>The most abundant and natural source of heat is sunlight. During the day, the sun provides direct heat through solar radiation, as well as indirect heat by raising the temperature of your surroundings. When the sun is not sufficient (or present), we must look to other ways of providing heat. The most obvious solution is to use fire as a source of heat.</p>
    <p>The earliest "space heating" systems were fireplaces and hearths installed inside of homes, where combustion gasses were vented outside through chimneys.</p>
